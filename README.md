## Hi 👋🏻 I'm Zoltan

I help teams build and ship modern JavaScript applications for enterprise environments — dashboards, SaaS tools, workflow interfaces such as budget views, reporting tables, scheduling, and integration-heavy internal platforms. My work emphasizes clarity, maintainability, and reliable end-to-end API integrations across frontend and backend. Async, autonomous, remote-first work style.
